Initially I worked on setting up the virtual environment and loading all the neccesary packages manually. 
I created a virtual environment with the following:
 - VirtualBox
 - Ubuntu
 - Python 3.7.0
 - Apahce
 - PHP
 - MySql
 
 I am able to start the vm manually and write infroamtion to the database and read that information to an HTML file.
 
 This week I worked on creating a python script to automate starting the vm, ssh into the vm and load a list of packages via a python script.
 There is still work to do to as I would like to create a log file and change the environment to work with other cloud services.
 
This is my update as of October 4th 2018.
